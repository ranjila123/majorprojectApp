This repo is part of a project called "Offline Handwritten Text Extraction and Recognition of NCE Admission Form". This project aims to address the difficulties in maintaining and analyzing hard-copy NCE Admission forms through offline handwriting recognition for the English language using a CNN-BLSTM-CTC neural network. This repo mainly contains code for the frontend of the Android application and the connection of the app with the backend. Through this Android application, the user can upload an image of the NCE Admission form and download the CSV file after backend processing. The backend part of this project is on another repository called "Backend".
